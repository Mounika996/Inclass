I was very  much interested in solving the problems from my high school, # that made to choose computer science background . I did my under graduation in computer science and I am familiar with c , c++ , java , HTML,CSS,XML, Database Sql ,Hadoop. 
# I have done few projects during my  under graduation the one I have done is “Fee management system “ where students who did not pay the fee are found and are notified to their 
# parents phone number and  their email address, to create this web page we used HTML, JS , java , Database and the other one is “Performance Appraisal Tracker” where the employee 
# performance in the company is recorded day to day and the managers give them an average grading points of all the days in a week and this help the employee to know in which area 
# they need to improve in order to have the good position and hike and appreciation in the company . During my under graduation in the 7th semester I was placed in IBM . I worked for # an year in IBM as an Associate system engineer. I worked on  Mainframes , JCL ,VSAM in the project and I worked on many productional issues , change requests according to the client # requirements, deployments.
# By having all the previous knowledge in the science background to develop my skill on designing a websites and styling them I opted for this course . I would need more practical 
# experience to create a good web sites and I would expect to do more hands-on and get benefits out of this course.
